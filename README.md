## Javascript Homework

  <li>
    There were actually 2 possible assignemnts that students were able to do (letter guess or word guess). I previously did the easier assignment, but this time around I did the harder one and even completed all of the bonus challenges that requried students to re-build the javascript in the Object Oriented Programming Model.
